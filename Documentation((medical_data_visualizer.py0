In this we will visualize and make calculations from medical examination data using(Pandas,seaborn and matplotlib).
The datadset values were collected during medical examination


File_name=medical_examination.csv
Reading the Dataset:
-The dataset medical_examination.csv is read into a Pandas DataFrame.

Adding Overweight Column:
-A "BMI" (Body Mass Index) column is calculated using weight and height. Height is converted from centimeters to meters.
-The "Overweight" column is added: a value of 1 if the BMI is greater than 25 (overweight) and 0 otherwise.

Normalizing Data:
-The cholesterol and glucose levels are normalized: values greater than 1 are set to 1 (indicating high cholesterol/glucose), and values less than or equal to 1 are set to 0.

Drawing a Categorical Plot:
-A function draw_cat_plot() is defined to generate a count plot showing the distribution of categorical variables (cholesterol, gluc, smoke, alco, active, and Overweight) against the target variable cardio.
-The plot is saved as a PNG file (catplot.png).

Drawing a Heatmap:
-A function draw_heat_map() is defined to generate a heatmap of correlations between the features.
-Data is filtered by removing outliers (e.g., ensuring ap_lo <= ap_hi and using quantiles for height and weight).
-The correlation matrix is computed, and a mask is applied to hide the upper triangle of the heatmap (to avoid redundant information).
-The heatmap is plotted using seaborn and saved as heatmap.png.



Graph summary:
The graph reveals significant differences in health behaviors and conditions between individuals with and without cardiovascular disease. 
People with cardiovascular disease are more likely to have high cholesterol and glucose levels and to be overweight. 
Meanwhile, those without the disease tend to have normal levels in these areas and are generally not overweight.
Interestingly, both groups have higher numbers of non-smokers, non-drinkers, and physically active individuals. This 
suggests that lifestyle choices play a crucial role in managing and potentially preventing cardiovascular disease.
